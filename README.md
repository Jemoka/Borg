# Borg
*Because I hate setting up terminals.*

I, like you, are but human. Our time here on this earth is a limited period though which we, hopefully, could enact some change in this world.

None of this time should be spent configuring the nitty-gritty of zsh. None of it.

Hence, I present Borg. Making your terminal look like mine, which, honestly, I think looks pretty good.

## That Line You Are Looking For
@@@This Works ONLY on macOS right now@@@
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jemoka/Borg/master/borg.sh)"
```
**Wait! This guy is making me configure zsh using bash!** Yeah, yeah. The Borg also use Brew to install zsh for you, so we start with Bash.

## What do I get?
Well, let's see.

1. Zsh, first of all
2. Minimal PowerLevel10K config with Zsh
2. Brew
3. Tmux
3. A very beautiful NeoVim with fun settings
    1. CoC (with no language server installed, though)
    2. EasyFuzzyMotion
    3. Ayu Dark theme
    4. VimPlug and readable/configurable `init.nvim`
4. Mosh

So, in summary...
